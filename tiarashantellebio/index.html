    <H1><strong>Hello. My name is Tiara and I’m an artistic hippie trying to make a difference in society.</strong></H1>

 <p>I’ve always been the type to help people. I even thought about being a psychologist my freshman year of college. I just never could shake the creative gene in me. So I thought, “why not combine both?” Merge my love for helping people with my passion for art, and see what type of career I can have.</p>
<p>It’s everyone’s duty to advocate for the marginalized groups. Therefore, I love creating equality themed projects. The meaningful and rich messages revolve around topics such as:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Women’s rights
    <li>Racial equality
    <li>LGBTQ
    <li>Self love
</ul>
    <p><strong>There’s definitely no turning back!</strong>
    The content, the truths within the stories, are all real and relate to many individuals in the world. The work I’ve done includes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Videos/short films
    <li>Short essays
    <li>Poetry
    <li>Photography
</ul>
<p>I hope you’re touched and enlightened while experiencing these works of art.</p>
